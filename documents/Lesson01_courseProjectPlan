<h1>Proposal</h1>
<p>My course project will be a website on book recommendations to users age 16-30. The website will include a blog as well as a section that will recommend various books to users with the help of the Goodreads API. This API will access user accounts and help the website provide recommendations quickly and efficiently. Goodreads has several API methods, including author.books that paginates an author’s books, author.show that gets info about an author via id, and book.review_counts that gets the review statistics of book via ISBN.</p>

<h1>Objective</h1>
<p>To provide a one-stop website that gives young millennials recommendations of popular/hyped books by analyzing general ratings on Goodreads as well as the user’s data. There are roughly 2.2 million new titles published each year, which can make finding a new book overwhelming, especially for young professionals looking for their next read. Most Americans read or listen to an average of 12 books a year (i.e., one book per month), meaning that each book needs to count. Thanks to social media, there is a lot of noise surrounding certain publications, such as <em>Becoming</em> by Michelle Obama or <em>Lean In</em> by Sheryl Sandenberg. Which book should a potential choose? This website will take advantage of the Goodreads API to provide recommendations that best fit into a reader’s lifestyle and reading goals.</p>
